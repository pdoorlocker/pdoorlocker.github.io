					<p id="first-line">The first GPS to truly help you get away from it all!</p>
					<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of Amelia Earhart! As a group of wiley youths, our team here at Earhart GPS wondered what it would be like to fly across the Atlantic (not the Pacific, teehee!), unburdened by the responsibilities of the modern world.</p>

					<p>You may also feel that it can be difficult to truly be present, to truly feel a part of an adventure when you get in your vehicle of choice, and follow that voice in your head or on your dashboard - and that's what Earhart GPS is designed for.</p>

					<p>Without the ability to zoom out on the map, you get to experience the wonder that Amelia had - true, unadulterated adventure, unspoilt by "a sense of direction" or "having any idea where you're going". Finally, you can find <i>yourself</i> with Earhart GPS.</p>
